# Project: Hangman

In groups of three or four, grab a whiteboard and come up with pseudocode for hangman.

## Setup and workflow
### Fork and add collaborators
- One group member must Fork my [original repository](https://github.com/ICS3U-Gallo/project-hangman).
- That group member will go into the newly forked repo, in `Settings -> Collaborators and teams`, add your group members' GitHub usernames or associated email addresses. This will allow everyone to freely make changes on that forked repo.

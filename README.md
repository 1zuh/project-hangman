# Project: Hangman

In groups of three or four, grab a whiteboard and come up with pseudocode for hangman.

## Setup and workflow
### Fork and add collaborators
- One group member must Fork my [original repository](https://github.com/ICS3U-Gallo/project-hangman).
- That group member will go into the newly forked repo, in `Settings -> Collaborators and teams`, add your group members' GitHub usernames or associated email addresses. This will allow everyone to freely make changes on that forked repo.
### Create a group branch
Create a branch whose name is based on what game feature you will be working on. For example, if you are responsible for the code that checks if a guess is correct, call the branch `guess-checking` (or something).
### Code!
Write your code **in the appropriate branch**. You will want to verify that your particular code works by coming up with test cases.
### Submit pull request
When you have verified that your code works, submit a pull request. Note: make sure you are on YOUR fork, not my original repo. At the top of the repo should have `your-user-name/project-hangman`. **Your username!**
- In your repo, go into the `Pull requests` tab.
- Click the green `New pull request` button.
**PAY ATTENTION TO THE FOLLOWING STEPS**
- It will automatically select my *original* repository as the "base fork", which is good! **However**, the "base" needs to be the class you are in (`grade-11b, grade-11c, or grade-10`).
- Wrte a nice message including your group members and what the pull request is for (i.e., checking if a letter is in a word).

# Hangman (Pseudocode)

```
Generate a word
Ask player for a character
Player chooses a character
Check if the character is found in the word
If the character is in the word, display the character and do not print a new part of the body
If the character is not in the word, display a (new) part of the body and the character in a separate list
If player determines all the characters in the word correctly, they win
If the whole body is printed before player determins all characters correctly , they lose
Game ends
